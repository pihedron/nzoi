# NZOI Solutions

This project contains solutions to some of the problems on the [NZOI Training Website](https://train.nzoi.org.nz).

## Languages

I solved most of the problems using Python, but for some of them I used C#, JavaScript, or Java. It is better to use Java or C++ because they are the standard choice for the International Olympiad in Informatics.

## Time Complexity

For some graph problems like **Sunsprint**, Python is not fast enough to complete all subtasks. Each folder may contain a `README.md` file for guidance on the problem.
